For this assignment, there are 5 files: GenStack.h, GenStack.cpp, SyntaxChecker.h, SyntaxChecker.cpp, and main.cpp. There are also 2 files, C++Sample and JavaSample that were used for error checking - JavaSample has an error on line 105(there's no closing parentheses) and C++Sample has an error on line 90 so user can be notified of their mistake.

This program uses a Makefile to compile, type make all in your terminal and ./assignment3 FileName to run.

I worked alone on this assignment, the references I used were the textbook, help from office hours, the examples we did in class and the following links:

* [Checking if the command line arguments are correct](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/)
