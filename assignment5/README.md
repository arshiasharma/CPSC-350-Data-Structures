For this assignment, there's 17 files: BST.h, BST.cpp, Faculty.h, Faculty.cpp, GenDoublyLinkedList.h, GenDoublyLinkedList.cpp, GenStack.h, GenStack.cpp, ListNode.h, ListNode.cpp, Simulation.h, Simulation.cpp, Student.h, Student.cpp, TreeNode.h, TreeNode.cpp, and main.cpp. There's also two text files, facultyTable and studentTable used for testing the program.

This program uses a Makefile to compile, type make all in your terminal and ./assignment5.out to run. The program runs fully as to the assignment guidelines with an addition with choice 11, with changing a student’s advisor given the student ID and new faculty ID. Choice 11 can also be used in rollback.
