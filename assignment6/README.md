Section 02


For this assignment, there are only 3 files: Simulation.h, Simulation.cpp, and main.cpp. There's also one text file, file.txt used for testing the program.

This program uses a Makefile to compile, type make all in your terminal and ./assignment6.out file.txt to run. There is also a Latex PDF report of the analysis of the Sorting algorithms, as well as the Latex code.

There were several sources used for the assignment and they are explained below, including the textbook. I got advice from Alex M. from class about how to get the time duration with using chrono and system_clock, instead of what I was doing before when it was just printing out the exact time the program started. They are cited below along with the references for Merge/Quick Sort, while the other 3 algorithms were discussed in class.
