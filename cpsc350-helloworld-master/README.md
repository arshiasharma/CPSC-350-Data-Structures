# cpsc350-helloworld

This file's purpose is to show our use of git and the git commands to push our helloworld file to Github. On my respository, the README was initialized in the start of the program and was editted on vi on the terminal. 

The helloworld file was written in Atom and had two commits, one file that runs the code without and the current file has the comments included.

The commands used for Github through Docker were as follows:
 - git clone respository url
 - git add *.*  -> the * are blocked but it should have a * before and after the .
 - git commit -m "..."
 - git push origin master
